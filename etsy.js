// I understand why the find method was not being used correctly in this function and the next one. I think I realized that I could have switched out the method to be filter or forEach when I finished the homework yesterday, but didn't change it then because it was still displaying the correct answer.
// I changed this function to use the filter method and return the items that include 'wood' in the materials list
// Then, I used the map function to return just the title of the items within the array.  The console.log joins the items in the array with a line break.

// #6
// I found the ... syntax while looking at the reduce documentation on MDN. I searched for the meaning of ... and found that it is called spread syntax. If I understand correctly, spread works like a combination of push and splice (depending on where/how spread syntax is applied within a function). In this case, I only want the spread syntax on previous because that is the item I want to push into a new array. Since current becomes previous with the next loop of the function, there isn't a need to push both previous and current into the new array within the same loop.  I also don't need to specify the .who_made on previous because current finds the correct item for me and previous just pushes it into the new array, I don't need to reassign that to the .who_made key.
// Within the reduce function, after the previous and current calls and push into a new array, I call the filter function on that new array to only return things that include the 'i_did' value.
// I then log the length of of the new filtered array whoMade and concatenate a string after to present the correct text
var whoMade = items.reduce(function(previous, current) {
    return ([...previous, current.who_made]).filter(function(item) {
        return item.includes('i_did')
    })
}, [])
console.log(whoMade.length + ' were made by their sellers')
